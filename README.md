# Waste Water
Tracking viral load in waste water is leading indicator of coming Covid cases. New Orleans has been slow to start waste water testing, but there is now enough to analyze.

You can either run waste_water.py in your own evironment or use the New_Orleans_Covid_Wastewater_Analysis.ipynb notebook. Both will get the data, split the data into treatment plants and create a visualization for each plant.
